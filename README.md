## Tourmaline

Tourmaline is an amplicon (metabarcoding) sequence processing workflow for Illumina sequence data. It uses the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system as a wrapper for [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) and additional shell and Python scripts.

### Why should I use Tourmaline?

* **QIIME 2.** The core commands of Tourmaline, including the [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) package, are all commands of QIIME 2, one of the most popular amplicon sequence analysis software tools available. You can print all of the QIIME 2 and other shell commands of your workflow before or while running the workflow.
* **Snakemake.** Managing the workflow with Snakemake provides several benefits: 
  - **Configuration file** contains all parameters in one file, so you can see what your workflow is doing and make changes for a subsequent run.
  - **Directory structure** is the same for every Tourmaline run, so you always know where your outputs are.
  - **On-demand commands** mean that only the commands required for output files not yet generated are run, saving time and computation when re-running part of a workflow.
* **Parameter optimization.** The configuration file and standard directory structure make it simple to test and compare different parameter sets to optimize your workflow. Included code helps choose read truncation parameters and identify outliers in representative sequences (ASVs).
* **Reports.** Every Tourmaline run produces an HTML report containing a summary of your metadata and outputs, with links to web-viewable QIIME 2 visualization files.
* **Downstream analysis.** Analyze the output of single or multiple Tourmaline runs programmatically, with qiime2R in R or the QIIME 2 Artifact API in Python, using the provided R and Python notebooks or your own code.
